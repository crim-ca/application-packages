# CRIM - Stacker (v2)

This application is internally identical to the [original `snap7-stack-creation`][original-app] package, but employs
this Github repository as HREF `executionUnit` to permit deployment on *ADES* that do not support embedded package
definition.

[original-app]: https://www.crim.ca/stash/projects/OGC/repos/ogc-dockers/browse/snap7-stack-creation/
