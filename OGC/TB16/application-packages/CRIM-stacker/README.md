# CRIM - Stacker (v2)

This application is internally identical to the [original `snap7-stack-creation`][original-app] package, but employs
this Github repository as HREF `executionUnit` to permit deployment on *ADES* that do not support embedded package
definition.

We employ the process identifier ``ogc-tb16-stacker`` to differentiate it from other similar processes deployed.
