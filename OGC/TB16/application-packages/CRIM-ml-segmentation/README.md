# CRIM - ML Segmentation

This application is internally identical to the [original `crim-ml-segmentation`][original-ml-app] package, but employs
public docker reference to allow image discovery. Furthermore, the JSON deploy request payload uses the URL generated by 
this Github repository as HREF `executionUnit` to permit deployment on *ADES* that do not support embedded package
definition.

For easier identification (distinguish from the original), the `-public` suffix is applied to the process `id`.

The package itself provides a docker image which enables pixel-wise classification of recognized objects on an input
satellite image. More precisely, a pre-trained model with execute object recognition using a sliding window over the 
image and apply one of the seven (7) output classes indices (unless no-data: 0) to each corresponding pixel of the
output image.
